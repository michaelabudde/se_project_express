# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. I worked with databases, set up security and testing, and deployed web applications on a remote machine. In this most recent iteration the website is now hosted on a unique site with google cloud

## Technologies and Techniques Used

This project is an Express app built with Javascript, Nginx, Google Cloud, and React.

At this stage, I have:

- created a database and connected it to the server
- configured the first routes and controllers
- handled errors
- expanded the user schema with an email and password
- created routes and controllers for signing up and signing in
- created routes and controllers for modifying the current user data
- protected existing routes
