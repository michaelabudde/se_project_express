# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. I worked with databases, set up security and testing, and deployed web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

At this stage, I have:

- set up an Express project
- created a database and connect it to the server
- configured the first routes and controllers
- handled errors
